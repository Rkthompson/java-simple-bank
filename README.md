# java-simple-bank

This is a very basic example of class, if...else statement, do while loops and a switch in Java.

The terminal display accepts single character inputs to make menu selections.

5 options are displayed:
```JAVA
 System.out.println("A. Check Balance");
 System.out.println("B. Deposit");
 System.out.println("C. Withdraw");
 System.out.println("D. Previous transaction");
 System.out.println("E. Exit");
 ```
Functionality includes displaying current balance, adding to the balance, subtracting from the balance, and reviewing the last transaction.

There is no exception handling or input verification.  Lowercase characters are accepted and read as uppercase characters in the switch.
